 *  HexaPawn.java
 *
 *  A simple six pawn variant of the classic chess board game where
 *  the objective is simply to reach the other side of the board or
 *  to eliminate all opponent pieces or moves
 * 
 *  ***THOUGHT QUESTIONS***
 *
 *  1. In a R x C tree, where R is a row number and C is the number of columns, we derived
 *  that the resulting number of moves was (R^C+1)(R^(C-1)) = 252 for a 3x3 board. For a
 *  3x4 board there would be (3^4 +1)(3^3) = 2214 moves. In a 3x5 board we would have
 *  (3^5+1)(3^4) = 19764 moves. 
 *
 *  2. If you have two computers pit against each other and H.I.M. makes the first move,
 *  then H.I.M. will ultimately win more games because the "computer" who makes the first
 *  move will be able to prune their entire gameTree of all the bad moves. The second computer
 *  or H.E.R. will not have the opportunity to prune moves because the first comuputer concedes
 *  early if it "knows" that there are no move possible winning moves left. The first computer
 *  prunes the parent of the parent which does not allow the H.E.R. machine to have any winning 
 *  moves so it will result to conceding fairly frequently. In larger boards, the ratio will reach
 *  a more balanced outcome instead of the 95-5 ratio we have now but the first computer will
 *  still have more wins.
